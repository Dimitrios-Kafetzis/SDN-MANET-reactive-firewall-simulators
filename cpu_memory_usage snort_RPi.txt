1) Measure CPU usage of Snort IDS: For this, you can use a tool like top, htop, or pidstat.

For example, if you want to use pidstat, you can start by finding the PID (process ID) of Snort IDS using pgrep or pidof:
--> pidof snort

Then you can use pidstat to measure the CPU usage:
--> pidstat -u -p [PID]

Replace [PID] with the process ID of Snort IDS. This command will report the CPU usage of the process every second. You can adjust the frequency by changing the number after -u.

2) Measure Memory usage of Snort IDS: You can use similar tools to measure memory usage. For example, with pidstat, you can use:
--> pidstat -r -p [PID]
This command will report the memory usage of the process.

3) Estimate Energy Usage: Once you have the CPU and memory usage, you can estimate the energy usage. This is more complex and involves a lot of factors, like the specific hardware you are using, the efficiency of your power supply, etc.

For a rough estimate, you could use a formula like this:
Power (in Watts) = CPU Usage (in %) * Max CPU Power (in Watts)

The Max CPU Power is a characteristic of your specific CPU. You can find it in the technical specs of your CPU.
